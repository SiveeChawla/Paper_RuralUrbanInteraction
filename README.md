# RD_4_Institutions
bout the project: The project provides the access to the model that was developed to address the research questions for my PhD thesis titled “An investigation of the spatial influences and governance implications of social-ecological heterogeneity, connectivity, and scale on landscape change”. 
For details about the model, sub-modules, inputs, and parameters, please refer to Chapter 2 of the thesis. 
Description of the folder structure: 
The model was developed in Matlab. Input simulated images and analysis of the results were performed in RStudio. The project includes three main folders each corresponding to chapter 3, 4 and 5 respectively which further consisted of three subfolders. See figure 1 for the folder structure.

Figure 1: The map shows folder hierarchy in the project. Each folder at level 2 is named as chapter with a short description of the model name. The chapters are same as that in the thesis. 

Step 1: Develop Input images  

To start first start with developing input images developed using R-code (see folder R-code). Also, input images used in the thesis is also stored in Input Images folders for the respective chapter. 

Step 2:  Run the model

To run the model access the folder Model Code. The model is developed in Matlab. Copy all the matlab files in the same folder. The Main file has the Main function which calls rest of the functions and sub-modules. 
Reset folder paths for accessing the input files and writing the output images.
